# Conway's Game of Life

Welcome to the **Conway's Game of Life** project! This is a Python implementation of the famous cellular automaton devised by John Horton Conway in 1970. The game is a zero-player game, meaning it evolves on its own based on an initial configuration and a set of simple rules.

## Introduction

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton where each cell on a grid can be alive or dead. The game progresses in steps called generations, where the state of each cell is updated based on the number of its live neighbors. The game is known for the complexity and variety of patterns that can emerge from simple initial states.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

### Installing Pygame

You can install the Pygame library using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Cloning the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OussamaTabzioui/Game-life-of-mine.git
cd game-of-life
```

## Usage

Run the game by executing the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

The game window will open, and you can start interacting with the grid by placing cells and observing how the patterns evolve over time.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Click to add or remove live cells on the grid.
- **Zoom In/Out**: Use the keyboard to zoom in and out of the grid.
- **Glider Pattern**: Add a glider pattern with a keypress to observe one of the most famous spaceships in action.
- **Pause/Resume**: Pause and resume the simulation with a keypress.
- **Random Initial State**: Reset the grid with a random initial state.

## Controls

- `P`: Pause/Resume the simulation.
- `R`: Reset the grid with a random initial state.
- `G`: Add a glider at the mouse position.
- `+`: Zoom in.
- `-`: Zoom out.
- **Mouse Click (Left Button)**: Add a live cell at the clicked position.
- **Mouse Click (Right Button)**: Remove a live cell at the clicked position.

## Known Issues

- **Zooming and Mouse Interaction**: When zoomed in, the mouse position does not correspond accurately to the grid cells. This issue will be addressed in future updates.
